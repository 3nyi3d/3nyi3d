# About Me
## My Interests
 * Cars
    * I have an interest in cars. I enjoy learning about them and seeing them at car shows. More recently, I saw electric cars at a car show hosted by Wake Tech on North Campus at the Hendrick Center.
 * Electronics
    * We use electronics so much and for me, for the most part, I find it enjoyable. I don't just use electronics, I like to learn about them. How they work, what works for me, and how I can make them work. More recently, I have been watching and paying attention to Apple and their release of their new iPhones.
## Websites I Recommend
- [YouTube](youtube.com) - I find YouTube as the king of websites. This is one that everyone knows how to get to and it caters to anyone in any topic. For me, what I look for in YouTube is mainly entertainment with a side of education.
- [ChatGPT](chatgpt.com) - ChatGPT has became a very popular website nowadays. The growth of AI and the usage cases seen with them makes them a solid tool. I consider CHatGPT as one of the most well known AI chatbot that seems to be the most helpful when it comes to questions and ideas.
